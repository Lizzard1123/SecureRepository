2 - Main.java class


To begin, most beginner projects have only the the Main.java and a Driver.java classes.
I'll break down this project's Main.java class.

package frc.robot; //this is the location of the file

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.RobotBase; //imports are used to (literally) import methods, variables, etc. from another class or library

public final class Main { //this is the class name
  
  //varaibles that will be used class wide are declared here

  private Main() { //this is the constructor
  /**
   * the constructor instantiates variables declared above
   * if nothing needs to be instantiated this can be left blank, or if necessary the super(); method can be called
   * super(); will be explained later with hierarchy, interfaces, and abstraction
  }

  public static void main(String... args) { //this is the main method
    RobotBase.startRobot(Robot::new); //this is saying "in the RobotBase class use method startRobot() and input the parameter Robot::new
  }
}
