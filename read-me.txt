I'm not exactly sure why there is the "everythingWentWrong" folder, but WhatYouWant is the most recent version of this. 
I went back and commented on classes to clarify anything. My comments are at the top of each file in the paragraph blurb in the
/**
 * this thing
 */
Yeah, so ignore "everythingWentWrong." It was supposed to be the program for mecanum drive, but we didn't use it.
I didn't bother to continue to develop a program that wouldn't be used. I think the step-by-step guide of how my struggles
came to a functioning program I started is in the "everythingWentWrong" folder, but I know I didn't finish it.

GO HUSKIES! \o/

Stan Clinton Kane, Declan McKenna, Car Seat Headrest, Bring Me the Horizon, Hippo Campus, Billy Joel, and Cat Stevens.
I listened to A LOT of their music while writing this clusterf*ck.

I hope 'rona didn't treat you too harshly. ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ♡
